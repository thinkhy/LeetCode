1. Define States

To represent the decision at index i:

buy[i]: Max profit till index i. The series of transaction is ending with a buy.
sell[i]: Max profit till index i. The series of transaction is ending with a sell.
To clarify:

Till index i, the buy / sell action must happen and must be the last action. It may not happen at index i. It may happen at i - 1, i - 2, ... 0.
In the end n - 1, return sell[n - 1]. Apparently we cannot finally end up with a buy. In that case, we would rather take a rest at n - 1.
For special case no transaction at all, classify it as sell[i], so that in the end, we can still return sell[n - 1]. Thanks @alex153 @kennethliaoke @anshu2.
2. Define Recursion

buy[i]: To make a decision whether to buy at i, we either take a rest, by just using the old decision at i - 1, or sell at/before i - 2, then buy at i, We cannot sell at i - 1, then buy at i, because of cooldown.
sell[i]: To make a decision whether to sell at i, we either take a rest, by just using the old decision at i - 1, or buy at/before i - 1, then sell at i.
So we get the following formula:

buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 2] - prices[i]);   
sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + prices[i]);
3. Optimize to O(1) Space

DP solution only depending on i - 1 and i - 2 can be optimized using O(1) space.

Let b2, b1, b0 represent buy[i - 2], buy[i - 1], buy[i]
Let s2, s1, s0 represent sell[i - 2], sell[i - 1], sell[i]
Then arrays turn into Fibonacci like recursion:

b0 = Math.max(b1, s2 - prices[i]);
s0 = Math.max(s1, b1 + prices[i]);
4. Write Code in 5 Minutes

First we define the initial states at i = 0:

We can buy. The max profit at i = 0 ending with a buy is -prices[0].
We cannot sell. The max profit at i = 0 ending with a sell is 0.
